            Pokémon are peculiar creatures with a vast array of different abilities and appearances; many people, known as Pokémon trainers, capture and train them, often with the intent of battling others. Young Satoshi has not only
            dreamed of becoming a Pokémon trainer but also a <span style="color: red">"Pokémon Master,"</span> and on the arrival of his 10th birthday, he finally has a chance to <span style="color: blue">make</span> that dream a reality.
            Unfortunately <span style="color: blue">for</span> him, all three Pokémon available to beginning trainers have already been claimed and only Pikachu, a rebellious Electric-type Pokémon, remains. However, this chance encounter
            would mark the start of a lifelong friendship and an epic adventure! Setting off on a journey to become the very best, Satoshi and Pikachu travel across beautiful, sprawling regions with their friends Kasumi, a Water-type
            trainer, and Takeshi, a Rock-type trainer. But danger lurks around every corner. The infamous Team Rocket is always nearby, seeking to steal powerful Pokémon through nefarious schemes. It'<span style="color: red"
